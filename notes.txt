GOALS of OO 
    refactor our express apps to separate the view logic (routing) from model logic (data)
    compare different OO designs for interfacing with our database 
    Borrow useful ides from ORMS to build our own model layers

Object Orientation
    To help organize our code 
    OO can offer abstraction - the ability to hide implementation details when they arent needed 
    OO can offer encapsulation - the ability to group functionality into larger logical pieces 
        a "capsule"
            everything related to data/functionality lives in one file 
    OO can offer polymoprhism - the ability to implement similar functionality to different classes
        the ability to make similar things work similarly 
            We could have other types of variables with the same API
                if two data pieces have a similar data variable that may act differently (example, dogs and cats SPEAK, but dogs go woof and cats go MEOW)
